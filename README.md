# Gesture Control System

This project is a gesture recognition system that processes and recognizes gestures to perform specific actions. It consists of several components that work together to achieve this functionality.

# AI Hand Gesture Control System

This project uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control common computer tasks using a webcam. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it supports gestures for copy, cut, paste, select, screenshots, and even launching apps.

## üîß Tech Stack

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run This Project

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## Files Description

- **main.py**: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the system and orchestrates the gesture recognition process.

- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions that assist with gesture processing, such as data preprocessing and normalization.

- **gesture_map.py**: Defines the logic for mapping recognized gestures to specific actions. It includes classes or functions that handle the gesture recognition logic.

- **screenshots/**: A directory intended to store screenshots captured during the gesture recognition process for reference or debugging purposes.

- **logs/**: This directory contains log files. The `gesture_log.csv` file logs actions taken by the system, including timestamps and recognized gestures.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd gesture_control
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

To run the gesture recognition system, execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```

Ensure that your camera is accessible and properly configured to capture gestures.
